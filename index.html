        <h3>BPC-157 (10mg & 5mg)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>BPC-157</strong> is a pentadecapeptide composed of 15 amino
          acids. It is a partial sequence of body protection compound (BPC) that
          is discovered in and isolated from human gastric juice. We offer
          BPC-157 in <strong>5mg</strong> and <strong>10mg</strong> vials. Our
          BPC-157 is HPLC tested to ensure >99% purity. (CAS: 137525-51-0)

        <h3>Melanotan 2 (MT2)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Melanotan 2</strong> is a synthetic analogue of the peptide
          hormone alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). It is widely
          used in research settings. We supply high-grade Melanotan 2 in
          <strong>10mg</strong> vials. Store in a cool, dry place away from

        <h3>Are your peptides tested for 99% purity?</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, absolutely. Every batch we sell undergoes rigorous HPLC testing
          to ensure a minimum of 99% purity.
        </p>

        <h3>How long does shipping take?</h3>

          Brisbane) arrive within 1-3 business days.
        </p>

        <h3>Do you ship internationally?</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, we only ship within Australia to ensure the fastest
          delivery times and no customs delays.
        </p>

        <h3>How should I store my peptides?</h3>
        <p>
          Lyophilized (powder) peptides should be stored in a freezer.
          Reconstituted peptides must be kept in the refrigerator.
